## Overview
### Description
Multi-Purposful instant messanger, contact anyone on your campus, schedule organizer and group project strategies. Group chat with additional capablities  that can potentially improve group project experiences 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as WhatsApp or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Allow users to connect instantly with anyone on campus, schedule effective meeting times, organize deadlines and utilize information on different group project stategies
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often or unoften as the user would like depending on how intreged they are with instant messaging and what exactly they are looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start by showing a list of potential contacts and recent contact threads, Then the user has the choice to instant message a single person or form a group and utilize the addition features. This can potienally optimize collaberation between students.
